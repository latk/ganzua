Ganzua
======

A tool for picking dependency information from Python lockfiles,
and manipulating the version constraints in `pyproject.toml` files.

For example, we can summarize the differences between two `uv.lock` files.
By default, we get JSON output:

```console
$ ganzua diff tests/{old,new}-uv-project/uv.lock
{
  "annotated-types": {
    "old": null,
    "new": {
      "version": "0.7.0"
    }
  },
  "typing-extensions": {
    "old": {
      "version": "3.10.0.2"
    },
    "new": {
      "version": "4.14.1"
    }
  }
}
```

We can also opt in to Markdown output, which will produce a table:

```console
$ ganzua diff --format=markdown tests/{old,new}-uv-project/uv.lock
| package           | old      | new    |
|-------------------|----------|--------|
| annotated-types   | -        | 0.7.0  |
| typing-extensions | 3.10.0.2 | 4.14.1 |
```

### ganzua help

Usage: `ganzua help [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]...`

Show help for the application or a specific subcommand.

**Options:**

* `--all`
  Also show help for all subcommands.
* `--markdown`
  Output help in Markdown format.


### ganzua inspect

Usage: `ganzua inspect [OPTIONS] LOCKFILE`

Inspect a lockfile.

**Options:**

* `--format [json|markdown]`
  Choose the output format, e.g. Markdown. [default: json]
* `--help`
  Show this help message and exit.


### ganzua diff

Usage: `ganzua diff [OPTIONS] OLD NEW`

Compare two lockfiles.

**Options:**

* `--format [json|markdown]`
  Choose the output format, e.g. Markdown. [default: json]
* `--help`
  Show this help message and exit.


### ganzua constraints

Usage: `ganzua constraints [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...`

Work with `pyproject.toml` constraints.

**Options:**

* `--help`
  Show this help message and exit.

**Commands:**

* `bump`
  Update `pyproject.toml` dependency constraints to match the lockfile.
* `remove`
  Remove any dependency version constraints from the `pyproject.toml`.


### ganzua constraints bump

Usage: `ganzua constraints bump [OPTIONS] PYPROJECT`

Update `pyproject.toml` dependency constraints to match the lockfile.

Of course, the lockfile should always be a valid solution for the constraints.
But often, the constraints are somewhat relaxed.
This tool will *increment* the constraints to match the currently locked versions.
Specifically, the locked version becomes a lower bound for the constraint.

This tool will try to be as granular as the original constraint.
For example, given the old constraint `foo>=3.5` and the new version `4.7.2`,
the constraint would be updated to `foo>=4.7`.

**Options:**

* `--lockfile FILE`
  Where to load versions from. Required.
* `--backup PATH`
  Store a backup in this file.
* `--help`
  Show this help message and exit.


### ganzua constraints remove

Usage: `ganzua constraints remove [OPTIONS] PYPROJECT`

Remove any dependency version constraints from the `pyproject.toml`.

This can be useful for allowing uv/Poetry to update to the most recent versions,
ignoring the previous constraints. Approximate recipe:

```bash
ganzua constraints remove --backup=pyproject.toml.bak pyproject.toml
uv lock --upgrade  # perform the upgrade
mv pyproject.toml.bak pyproject.toml  # restore old constraints
ganzua constraints bump --lockfile=uv.lock pyproject.toml
uv lock
```

**Options:**

* `--backup PATH`
  Store a backup in this file.
* `--help`
  Show this help message and exit.


### ganzua schema

Usage: `ganzua schema [OPTIONS] {inspect|diff}`

Show the JSON schema for the output of the given command.

**Options:**

* `--help`
  Show this help message and exit.

##  What does Ganzua mean?

The Spanish term *ganz√∫a* means lockpick. It is pronounced *gan-THU-a*.

This `ganzua` tool for interacting with Python dependency lockfiles
is unrelated to the [2004 cryptoanalysis tool of the same name](https://ganzua.sourceforge.net/en/index.html).
